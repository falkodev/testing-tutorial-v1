# Testing tutorial v1

This application is designed to help learn testing practices by simulating an e-commerce website.
The apprentice must create 3 entities and their CRUD operations by using TDD/BDD coding style :

- user
- product
- order

## Install and launch

After having installed Node, run `npm i` then `npm start` (or `npm run dev` to relaunch the server after each save).

In another terminal, run `npm run test` (or `npm run test:watch` to run test everytime a test is updated).

## Operations

For each entity, create integration tests for routes, and unit tests for controllers (get/create/update/delete)
